so the process will start when a single post will be created, that post is the op post.

if someone replies to it.

it will become a thread. and if someone dosen't it will just be there.

EVERY OTHER OP POST WILL HAVE A LIFE LINE OF 24 HRS IF SOMEONE REPLIES OR MAKES AN ACTIVIY IN THAT THREAD OR POST,
THE COUNTDOWN WILL BE RESTARTED ELSE THE OP POST WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED FROM THE DB.
